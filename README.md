Hello this is Salty :
I made this macro out of boredom. It is for Divine Duality.


currently only works for 2560x1440 and will contain a seperate file for 1920x1080 (or I do variable hell, idk)
Does not have OCR yet due to gradient numbers causing issues. I either find a workaround, take 2000 pictures, or just stick with a timer / set levels people can choose to reset at (right now it's just a rough timer, not even sure for how long I have not fully tested it)


F1 is start :
F2 is start and reset at a level :
F3 is reload :
F4 is close

that should be it. I uploaded it now as to not forget but it is not finished. it probably wont even compile yet. I'll include an exe option too ig.
