This relies on ahk v1.1 to run, you can download that at https://www.autohotkey.com (goto the website to download it)
You're monitor's scale MUST be 100% or else it will not work (go to monitors in settings)
Roblox MUST NOT be full screen or else it will not work (it needs the white bar at the top of the screen)

Hello this is Salty :
I made this macro out of boredom. It is for Divine Duality.

F1 is start : F2 is start and reset at a level : F3 is reload : F4 is close : F5 joins a random public server

This works on 2560x1440p and should work on 1920x1080p : 
please dm me with any issues (asaltyacc / ASaltyAccount)
