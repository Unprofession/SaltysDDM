Hello this is Salty :
I made this macro out of boredom. It is for Divine Duality.

F1 is start :
F2 is start and reset at a level :
F3 is reload :
F4 is close :
F5 joins a random public server

This works on 2560x1440p and should work on 1920x1080p : 
please dm me with any issues (asaltyacc / ASaltyAccount)

That should be it. I'll include an exe option too ig, I'll add it in a sec
