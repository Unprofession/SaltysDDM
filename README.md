Hello this is Salty :
I made this macro out of boredom. It is for Divine Duality.

F1 is start : F2 is start and reset at a level (unsure of the best) : F3 is autoroll (disabled for testing)

F4 is join random public server : F5 is Reload : F6 is Close

To add a vip link code just open the script in notepad or any other text editor
then READ THE DIRECTIONS and enter it below the line that says

;; INSERT LINK CODE BELOW


This works on 2560x1440p and should work on 1920x1080p : 
please dm me with any issues (asaltyacc / ASaltyAccount)
